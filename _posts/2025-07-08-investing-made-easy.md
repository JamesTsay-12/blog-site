# Investing Made Easy with Low Expenses

Many people want to invest with minimal hassle. One of the simplest and most effective ways to do this is by contributing regularly to **low-cost ETFs and mutual funds**, which aggregate hundreds or thousands of stocks into a single investment.

These funds can be purchased easily through platforms like **E*TRADE**, **Vanguard**, or **Fidelity**. Historically, **about 90% of actively managed funds underperform the S&P 500 over the long term** ([source](https://www.investopedia.com/can-you-beat-sp-500-11738589)).

The key to successful ETF investing is:
- **Long-term holding** (20+ years)
- **Not selling during downturns**
- **Reinvesting dividends** for compound growth

An additional benefit: many of these funds have **high dividend yields**, boosting your **total real return**. You can evaluate total return performance here: [TotalRealReturns.com](https://totalrealreturns.com)

  - Mutual fund with zero fees, international focus
> ðŸ“Œ **Note:** International funds are included to diversify outside of the U.S., as it's uncertain whether U.S. stocks will continue to outperform global markets indefinitely. I've provided both Vanguard (V) and Fidelity (F) versions since many 401(k) accounts limit your broker options.


## ðŸš€ Higher Growth Fund Options (More Volatile)

These ETFs focus on high-growth sectors or subsets of the market. They may outperform in bull markets but tend to decline more sharply during downturns.

- **[VGT](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vgt)** â€“ Vanguard Information Technology ETF (expense ratio: 0.09%)
- **[VUG](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vug)** â€“ Vanguard Growth ETF (expense ratio: 0.04%)
