# Wealth Allocations: What People Do vs. What Works

## Introduction: Are We Investing the Right Way?

Most investors build their portfolios based on instinct, habit, or what they see others doing. But how do these real-world allocations compare to what’s recommended by financial theory and advisors focused on optimizing long-term returns?  I also want to explore what some constraints and barriers of entry there are for growing high wealth.

This article compares **actual asset allocations across net worth tiers** to **recommended strategies** backed by research and theory, then evaluates how those choices affect **wealth generation potential and risk exposure**.

## Section 1: How People Actually Allocate Wealth

Based on data from the [Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm), [BofA Global Wealth Report](https://business.bofaml.com/en-us/content/global-wealth-report.html), [Tiger 21 Group](https://tiger21.com/), and [SmartAsset](https://smartasset.com/investing/ultra-high-net-worth-asset-allocation), here's how real investors allocate assets:

| Net Worth Tier   | Public Equities | Private Equity / Business | Real Estate | Alternatives | Cash / Bonds | Est. Return |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| < $250K          | 40–60%          | 0–5%                      | 10–30%      | <5%          | 20–40%       | ~4.5–5.5%   |
| $250K–$1M        | 60–70%          | <5%                       | 15–25%      | <5%          | 10–20%       | ~5–6%       |
| $1–5M            | 50–60%          | 5–10%                     | 20–30%      | 5–10%        | 10–15%       | ~6–6.5%     |
| $5–25M           | 40–55%          | 15–25%                    | 15–25%      | 5–10%        | 5–10%        | ~6.5–7%     |
| $25–50M          | 25–45%          | 25–40%                    | 20–30%      | 10–15%       | 5–10%        | ~7–8%       |
| $50M+            | 20–30%          | 30–50%                    | 20–25%      | 10–20%       | 5–10%        | ~7.5–8.5%   |

## Section 2: Recommended Wealth Allocations for Long-Term Returns

**Basis for Estimated Returns:** Estimated returns in the recommended allocations are derived from historical averages and institutional allocation models (e.g., Yale Endowment, Bogleheads, and Morningstar). For example:

- **Public Equities**: 6–8% real return annually
- **Private Equity / Business Ownership**: 8–12% IRR historically ([McKinsey Global Private Markets Report](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-capital/our-insights/global-private-markets-report))
- **Real Estate**: 6–8% long-term blended returns ([NAREIT](https://www.reit.com/data-research/reit-indexes/historical-reit-industry-performance))
- **Alternatives**: 4–12% depending on strategy
- **Cash / Bonds**: 2–5% depending on interest rates ([Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/lp/market-fair-value))

Using frameworks from [Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investment_strategies), [Yale Endowment](https://investments.yale.edu/), and [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1011705/how-to-build-a-portfolio-based-on-your-net-worth), here’s what optimal portfolios **might** look like:

| Net Worth Tier   | Public Equities | Private Equity / Business | Real Estate | Alternatives | Cash / Bonds | Est. Return |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| < $250K          | 70–80%          | 0%                        | 0–10%       | 0–2%         | 10–20%       | ~5.5–6.5%   |
| $250K–$1M        | 60–70%          | 0–5%                      | 10–20%      | 0–5%         | 15–25%       | ~6%         |
| $1–5M            | 55–65%          | 5–10%                     | 15–20%      | 5%           | 10–15%       | ~6.5–7%     |
| $5–25M           | 40–50%          | 20–30%                    | 15–20%      | 5–10%        | 10–15%       | ~7.5–8.5%   |
| $25–50M          | 30–40%          | 30–40%                    | 20–25%      | 10–15%       | 5–10%        | ~8–9%       |
| $50M+            | 25–35%          | 40–50%                    | 20–25%      | 10–20%       | 5–10%        | ~8.5–9.5%   |

**Note on Alternatives:** Includes hedge funds, commodities, private credit, structured products, collectibles, crypto, etc. See [CFA Institute](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/research/cfa-digest/2022/06/liquidity-and-portfolio-management).

## Section 3: Comparing Outcomes — Efficiency vs. Behavior

This side-by-side comparison shows real-world portfolios are often:

- **Overweight in real estate and cash**, reducing compounding potential ([Morningstar Cost of Waiting Study](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1017110/the-cost-of-waiting))
- **Underweight in equities and alternatives** ([ChooseFI Podcast](https://www.choosefi.com/podcast/))
- **Under-allocated to private equity**, a key driver of wealth at higher tiers ([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-equity-and-principal-investors/our-insights/global-private-markets-review-2023))

Missing even 1–2% annually can mean 25–50% less wealth after 30 years. See supplemental info at the end.

## Section 4: Tradeoffs and Real-World Constraints

### Section 4.1: Why People Deviate from the Optimal

- **Access:** Private investments often require accreditation or high minimums  
- **Liquidity:** Lower-tier investors keep more cash for emergencies  
- **Psychology:** Homeownership and cash feel “safe”  
- **Behavior:** Peer mimicry and outdated habits

---

### Section 4.2: Reconciling High-Net-Worth Allocations

[SmartAsset](https://smartasset.com/investing/ultra-high-net-worth-asset-allocation) data shows high-net-worth investors hold less cash than mainstream investor models suggest:

| Asset Allocation       | Ultra-High Net Worth (> $30M) | High Net Worth ($1M portf) |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Cash                   | 10%                           | 2%                         |
| Alternatives           | 46%                           | 22%                        |
| Fixed Income           | 15%                           | 33%                        |
| International Equities | 9%                            | 15%                        |
| Domestic Equities      | 20%                           | 28%                        |

Also see [FMG Discussion Paper 885, page 50](https://www.fmg.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2023-08/DP885.pdf) which supports the finding that allocations to private equity and alternatives increase significantly with higher wealth levels.

This contradicts many public portfolios that overallocate to cash. For investors with >$1M, it suggests **lower cash/bond allocations** may be better aligned with actual wealthy investor behavior. This also highlights some contradictory data where we see there is a large range in which very wealthy individuals allocate alternatives and private equity. 
What we can take away is that very wealthy people have much larger allocations in alternatives and private equity compared to less wealthy people.  They are also able to take advantage of investments which have big tax advantages (see smart asset article).

### Section 4.3: How to Access Private Equity and Alternative Investments

Private equity and alternatives can boost returns but are harder to access:

- **Accredited Investor Status:** Required for most private funds
- **Private Equity ETFs/Mutual Funds:**  
  - [PSP - Invesco Listed Private Equity ETF](https://www.invesco.com/portal/site/us/investors/etfs/product-detail?productId=PSP)  
  - [BlackRock Private Opportunities Fund](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/268217/blackrock-private-opportunities-fund-inc)
- **Interval Funds / Registered Alts:**  
  - [WhiteHorse Specialty Finance Fund](https://whitehorsecapital.com/funds/whsf/)  
  - [BlackRock Alternative Strategies](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/268329/blackrock-alternative-strategies-fund)
- **Direct Investment Platforms:**  
  - [EquityZen](https://equityzen.com/)  
  - [Forge Global](https://forgeglobal.com/)  
  - [SeedInvest](https://www.seedinvest.com/)
- **Real Estate Crowdfunding:**  
  - [Fundrise](https://fundrise.com/)  
  - [RealtyMogul](https://www.realtymogul.com/)
- **Retail Brokerage Access:**  
  - [Fidelity Alternative Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/alternative-investments/overview)

**Note:** These often have higher fees, limited liquidity, and greater risk. Research is critical -  make sure you discuss with people you trust before executing.
I aim to discuss more on other alternatives such as crypto and collectibles separately.

## Section 5: How Personal Circumstances Affect Allocation

Individual differences matter:

- Family size and dependents
- Homeownership vs. renting
- Debt obligations
- Variable vs. stable income
- Health needs
- Time horizon

No strategy fits everyone — these need to be factored into any plan.  Life circumstances, choices, and constraints can strongly impact risk-taking and ability to achieve optimal outcomes in wealth.

---

## Section 6: Real-Life Case Studies

**Case Study 1: “The Average Saver”**

- Real estate >50%, minimal equities, no private equity
- Outcome: low growth, delayed wealth
- Source: [Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/)

**Case Study 2: Wealthy Investor — Bill Perkins**

- Public: ~20%, Private Equity: ~50%, Real Estate: ~15%, Alts: ~10%, Cash: ~5%
- Outcome: growth via concentration in high-return assets
- *Note: Allocation estimates based on interviews; exact figures may vary and needs to be verified*

---

## Conclusion

To build wealth:

- Reassess allocation by tier and goals
- Prioritize higher-return assets over “safe” ones if able to take higher risks
- Gradually shift allocations as access improves
- Consider practical advice from experts (I'll provide examples in follow-up blogs)

This blog is also providing more of a basis for why the wealthy can get even more wealthy faster than others - they have much more ability to take risks, tools, and access points for different investments at their disposal.

## Disclaimer

This article was generated in collaboration with ChatGPT and based on publicly available data and academic frameworks. The results generated for what typical investors do needs to be verified but you can use these numbers as guidelines.  Same goes for what more "optimal" allocations might be.  Consult a licensed advisor before making financial decisions.

I do not currently follow the recommended allocation strategy and am continuing to evaluate and test ideas. For example, I’m still exploring private equity access before committing larger stakes. Market conditions can change, and recent PE returns have softened. You can model your own scenarios using my [financial simulator](https://jamestsay-12.github.io/blog-site/finance/2025/06/25/retirement-simulation.html).

Unfortunately, some links may not work without creating accounts or passing paywalls — I’m working to improve this!

### Interpretation

- Even a 1% annual return difference compounds significantly over time.  
- The longer the horizon, the more critical it is to adopt allocations with higher expected returns.
