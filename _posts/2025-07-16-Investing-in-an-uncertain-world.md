# 🗺️ Investing in an Uncertain World: Rethinking Portfolio Strategy for the Future

*This blog is in progress and will be refined over time.*

**"Can we still invest like we used to?"**

That's the question many investors are asking as the world enters a new phase of uncertainty. This article is motivated by scenarios I've heard in casual conversations, podcasts, and news commentary — unsettling yet plausible questions like:

- What if the U.S. becomes embroiled in World War III or a nuclear conflict?
- What if the U.S. economy stagnates like Japan's, with low growth and a weakening currency?
- What if the U.S. loses its economic leadership globally?
- What happens as natural disasters increase due to climate change?
- What if AI displaces entire categories of jobs, leading to widespread unemployment?
- What if wealth inequality drives political shifts toward global socialism?

These questions aren't predictions, but they reflect the anxieties of our time. This piece explores whether the tried-and-true investing playbook is still sufficient — and what thoughtful investors might consider instead. as the world enters a new phase of uncertainty. From geopolitical conflict to AI disruption, the investing environment is changing fast. For decades, conventional wisdom said: diversify, stay the course, and ignore the noise. But in today's world, is that enough?

## 🌍 Global Forces Reshaping the Investment Landscape

The global investment environment is being shaken by:

- ⬇️ A **weakening U.S. dollar**, as global economies begin to de-dollarize trade
- 📆 **Tariffs and trade wars**, disrupting supply chains and inflating costs
- 💸 Persistent **inflation**, making cash holdings and some bonds less attractive
- ♻️ Government and private capital shifting toward **clean energy** and decarbonization, though U.S. federal subsidies for clean energy have recently declined
- 🌎 Uncertain **immigration and talent policies**, impacting global tech leadership
- 🔬 Lower **investment in research and innovation** in key sectors, including declining federal support for fundamental scientific research in the U.S.
- ⚔️ Major conflicts: **Russia-Ukraine, Israel-Gaza, Iran, and China-Taiwan tensions**

This isn't just noise. These are structural changes with long-term consequences.

## 👵️ Conventional Wisdom: Still Relevant, But Under Pressure

The classic Boglehead-style approach has stood the test of time:

- **Buy low-cost index funds**
- **Diversify broadly**
- **Hold long term, ignore the noise**

This strategy, made famous by John Bogle and embraced by platforms like Bogleheads.org, emphasizes simplicity and patience. For more details on this, please see this other blog:

[Easy Diversified Portfolio](https://jamestsay-12.github.io/blog-site/finance/2025/07/12/Easy-Diversified-Portfolio.html)

In a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V360AygOv7A), comedian Hasan Minhaj pushes back on conventional investing advice by questioning experts who advocate the 'set it and forget it' model—holding a diversified (in this case U.S.-based) stock portfolio long-term without considering changing global dynamics. He challenges the assumption that this passive strategy is universally safe, especially in the face of rising global instability, rapid technological change, and domestic economic uncertainty. 

His skepticism reflects a broader cultural questioning of whether blind faith in past models is sufficient for navigating the future.

## 🔄 Rethinking Strategy: Exploring Other Possibilities

If conventional U.S.-centric investing might be challenged by new global dynamics, what alternatives should thoughtful investors consider? Rather than a prescriptive answer, here are some **options** that investors may evaluate for both risk management and future opportunity.

### 🛡️ Wealth Preservation: Hedging Geographic and Asset Risk

Some asset types that may behave differently than U.S. equities include:

- **International ETFs** (e.g., VXUS, VWO, IEFA): to be clear the Bogleheads strategy includes having a minority international fund exposure for a fully diversifed portfolio
- **Gold or commodities**
- **Cryptoassets** for those open to high volatility
- **Bonds** (e.g., TIPS or short-duration)
- **Real assets** such as real estate or farmland
- **Private equity or alternatives** for those with access and risk appetite

These options can also serve as hedges against demographic imbalances. For instance, while aging populations in developed nations may slow growth, younger markets in parts of Asia and Africa could offer longer-term momentum—albeit with higher volatility.

It may also be worth tracking moves by sovereign wealth funds, which can quietly signal long-horizon investment themes across sectors and geographies.

### 🚀 Growth Opportunities: Investing in the Future

Innovation continues, and some may seek to allocate a portion of their portfolio to technologies or sectors they believe will define the next decade. Investors with a higher risk tolerance may consider buying into sharp market corrections — particularly in sectors like tech and AI — as part of a long-term thesis. This strategy, often referred to as 'buying the dip,' requires conviction and patience, but has historically rewarded those who avoid panic selling during downturns. Options include:

- **Growth and tech-oriented ETFs**: VUG, VGT, XLK, QQQM
- **Actively managed growth funds**: FBGRX or similar
- **Individual stocks** in areas like AI, semiconductors, or clean energy

That said, not all technology is created equal. Investors should consider that while AI and automation may drive long-term gains, they can also lead to workforce disruption and regulatory pushback—making selectivity and active management potentially more important than ever.

Furthermore, companies with more localized supply chains may be more resilient in a world facing increased geopolitical fragmentation and trade realignment.

Finally, maintaining **strategic liquidity**—having dry powder to deploy during dislocations—can be an underrated growth enabler. This could mean parking a portion of capital in high-interest savings accounts or short-term Treasury ETFs while awaiting better entry points. It's not about market timing, but being ready to act when opportunities arise.

### 🛍️ A More Nuanced Take on "Buying the Dip"

The Schwab article on market timing makes a great point: trying to predict the exact right time to invest usually doesn’t work out well. For most people, staying invested consistently beats jumping in and out of the market.

[Does Market Timing Work? – Charles Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/does-market-timing-work)

That said, there’s an alternative strategy that isn’t about broad market timing but can be used more selectively. One option is to take a disciplined, opportunistic approach—focusing on adding to high-quality companies during meaningful dips, especially when the drop seems disconnected from long-term fundamentals.

This kind of strategy might involve:

- Identifying companies with strong balance sheets and durable business models,
- Watching for price dislocations driven by short-term news or sentiment,
- Using dollar-cost averaging or staggered buys during volatility.

It’s not about trying to call the bottom—it’s about being prepared to act when quality meets value.

For those with a long-term horizon, this can be a thoughtful way to lean into volatility rather than avoid it entirely.  It is important to note that this strategy is higher risk and requires research and time investment.

<summary>📎 Supplemental: Should You Just Stick with the Bogleheads Strategy?</summary>

Many ask: “If the Bogleheads strategy has worked through 100 years of wars, inflation, political shifts, and market crashes — why change now?”

That’s a valid point. The classic approach — buy low-cost index funds, hold for the long term, and don’t try to time the market — has survived:

- World Wars and the Cold War  
- The Great Depression  
- The 1970s stagflation era  
- Dot-com and housing bubbles  
- 2008 financial crisis  
- COVID-19

In all these cases, U.S. stocks eventually recovered and rewarded patient investors.

But today’s structural shifts raise new questions:

### 1. 🇺🇸 U.S. Dominance Is No Longer Guaranteed
The 20th century was a U.S.-led economic era. Today we see a multipolar world: rising powers like China and India, fractured global supply chains, and de-dollarization efforts. Indexes like the S&P 500 may no longer reflect the full opportunity set — or the full risk landscape.

### 2. 🧠 Concentration Risk in Indexes
The S&P 500 is now top-heavy, with over 30% of its weight in just a few tech stocks. That means broad exposure isn’t as diversified as it once was. If AI, big tech, or regulation takes a hit, portfolios may suffer more than expected.

### 3. ⚠️ New Structural Risks
Climate shocks, AI-driven job displacement, geopolitical instability, and wealth inequality all raise risks that are not well-captured in a traditional index. These aren’t short-term cycles — they could shape the next 30 years.

### 4. 🔄 The Case for Evolution, Not Abandonment
It’s not about throwing away the Bogleheads playbook — it’s about **modernizing it**:

| Principle          | Classic Boglehead              | Future-Proofed Approach                               |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Diversification     | U.S.-centric index funds        | Add global, real assets, and alternatives             |
| Long-term mindset   | Hold through volatility         | Same — but reassess what “holding” means              |
| Simplicity          | Few low-cost ETFs               | Still simple — but more thoughtful allocations        |

> The Bogleheads philosophy worked because it was adaptive, low-cost, and behavioral. Those values still apply — but the implementation may need to evolve.

<summary>❓ Supplemental: Isn't Everything Correlated Now?</summary>

This is a fair concern — one we increasingly hear from investors frustrated that their portfolios didn't behave differently during recent market crashes.

It’s true that in extreme downturns, many asset classes — U.S. stocks, international equities, crypto, and even bonds — may all fall together. We’ve seen this in:

- **March 2020 (COVID crash)**: Broad global selloff  
- **2022 tightening cycle**: Equities, crypto, and fixed income all declined

So yes — correlations rise in a crisis.

### 1. 📉 Correlation ≠ Redundancy
Even if assets dip together during panics, they still tend to recover differently based on their **underlying drivers**:

- International stocks may benefit from commodity cycles or regional demographic growth
- Crypto is influenced by innovation, decentralization trends, and monetary skepticism
- Gold and real estate may hedge different risks like inflation or credit tightening

Over time, imperfect diversification still **smooths the ride**.

### 2. ⚙️ Diversification is about drivers, not just price movement
You want assets exposed to different **macroeconomic levers**:

- U.S. stocks → corporate earnings, domestic policy  
- Gold → inflation and crisis hedging  
- Bonds → interest rates and duration risk  
- Crypto → tech adoption, regulatory cycles  
- International → currency, growth themes, geopolitics

These respond differently to global events — even if they correlate in brief selloffs.

### 3. 🧩 Diversify across dimensions
- **Geography**: Not all markets react to U.S. politics or Fed decisions  
- **Time horizons**: Cash for short term, growth assets for long  
- **Liquidity**: Some assets move fast, others can’t be sold easily  
- **Structure**: Mix taxable and tax-advantaged accounts

In short: don’t diversify to avoid every loss — diversify to avoid concentration failure.

## 🤔 The Role of Diversification in Today's Market

In a world of many unknowns, diversification isn’t just about chasing returns — it’s about staying in the game. That might mean giving up the best-case outcome for a broader range of survivable ones.

While the instinct to sell during market turbulence is common, panic selling can lock in losses and derail long-term goals. Staying invested through volatility — particularly with a diversified portfolio — is often more effective than trying to time the market. Investors should consider defining rules for rebalancing or buying during dips to take emotion out of the equation.

There’s no need to abandon everything that’s worked. But assuming the next 30 years will look like the last 30 may not be prudent either.

Consider your exposure. Understand your assumptions. Then diversify accordingly.

## 📌 Final Thought

We may be entering a world where investing demands more flexibility and awareness. The challenge isn’t to find a perfect formula — it’s to navigate uncertainty with tools that are adaptive, thoughtful, and grounded.

## ❓ Common Questions and Misconceptions

### "Isn’t everything correlated now? Even crypto and international stocks?"

That’s a fair question — and a common critique of diversification in today’s markets. It’s true that in moments of panic or extreme drawdowns, many asset classes tend to move together. We’ve seen this in:

- **March 2020 (COVID crash)**: U.S. equities, international stocks, bonds, and crypto all fell sharply.
- **2022 tightening cycle**: Risk assets across the board took a hit.

So yes — correlations often rise in a crisis.

But here’s the nuance:

#### 1. **Correlation ≠ Redundancy**
Assets may be correlated in the short term but still offer meaningful diversification over the long term. For example:

- International markets may decline when the U.S. does — but their recovery paths and underlying drivers (e.g. commodities, demographics, currencies) differ.
- Crypto may track risk-on behavior, but it is fundamentally tied to themes like decentralized infrastructure and skepticism toward fiat currency — distinct from U.S. equities.

Even **imperfect diversification** can reduce long-term volatility and offer exposure to different return cycles.

#### 2. **Diversification isn’t just about correlation — it’s about *cause*.**
You want assets tied to different macro and structural drivers:

- U.S. stocks → domestic consumption, interest rates, corporate profits
- Emerging markets → commodity cycles, population growth
- Gold → inflation expectations and crisis hedging
- Crypto → innovation adoption and monetary policy skepticism
- Bonds → interest rate regimes and deflation protection

So while correlations may spike briefly, over time these assets respond to **different levers**.

#### 3. **There are layers to diversification.**
- **Geographic**: Exposure to non-U.S. political and monetary systems
- **Asset type**: Equities, bonds, commodities, alternatives
- **Liquidity**: Mixing liquid and illiquid holdings
- **Time horizon**: Aligning assets with short- and long-term needs

In short: you diversify not to eliminate every loss, but to avoid catastrophic concentration.
