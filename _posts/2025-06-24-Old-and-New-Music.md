Thanks for reading this music blog! The last time I had a personal page was ~20 years ago when I had 2 separate myspace music accounts anonymously sharing my ambient experimental music with others. Unfortunately, all of the content got lost with the myspace business transitions, and I had neglected the projects after getting busy with work.  I’ll be posting some of my old music that I can dig out that was recorded on budget equipment.  I recently got interested in trying to modernize my setup and learn about new technology after a long hiatus.  As I make more music, I’ll post some clips on the blog.
