# Easy Way to Diversify Your Portfolio with Low Expenses

This blog is in progress.

I want to provide options for building a portfolio as easy as possible and show some updated and modern options to add to a very popular and well accepted existing framework.

## ðŸ§  A Classic Baseline: The Bogleheads 3-Fund Portfolio

One of the most widely recommended strategies for simplicity and effectiveness is the **Bogleheads 3-Fund Portfolio**. It uses just three funds to provide **broad, global diversification** with **minimal expenses**:

| Fund Type              | Example ETF | Purpose |
|------------------------|-------------|---------|
| U.S. Total Stock Market | [VTI â€“ Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vti) | Covers entire U.S. equity market |
| International Stocks    | [VXUS â€“ Vanguard Total International Stock ETF](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vxus) | Exposure to non-U.S. developed & emerging markets |
| U.S. Bonds              | [BND â€“ Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bnd) | Core fixed income for stability |

This strategy is simple, low-maintenance, and very cost-effective â€” with **expense ratios under 0.05%** for all three components.

> ðŸ§© Typical allocations vary by risk tolerance (e.g., 60/30/10 or 40/20/40 for stocks/international/bonds).

### ðŸ†š Why Go Beyond It?

While the 3-fund portfolio is a great starting point, **it lacks exposure to real estate, gold, crypto, or private equity** â€” all of which have historically offered diversification and potential return benefits.

Thatâ€™s why the goal of this blog is to offer **a broader ETF-based approach** for those interested in **low-cost access to more asset classes** without needing special accreditation, active management, or high fees.

Below are options to build a diversified portfolio with minimal hassle and low expenses. I would only recommend the stock and bond ETF/mutual funds for now until I get more educated on the others. The stock ETFs and bonds are widely known and discussed widely with "Bogleheads" for which you can "set and forget."

The other ETFs and funds include assets which may require more research/monitoring and don't fall into the set-and-forget strategy.  Please see my disclaimer at the end.

## Drawbacks of Using Only ETFs and Mutual Funds for Alternatives, Real Estate & Private Equity Exposure

While building a diversified portfolio using ETFs and mutual funds is a practical and low-cost approach, itâ€™s important to understand some limitations of this strategyâ€”especially when it comes to alternatives, real estate, and private equity:

- **Limited Return Potential Compared to Direct Investments**  
  ETFs and mutual funds that track broad indices or hold publicly traded companies tend to deliver returns close to market averages. For example:  
  - REIT ETFs may not capture the full income and appreciation potential of direct real estate ownership or specialized real estate funds.  
  - Listed private equity ETFs (e.g., PSP) primarily invest in publicly traded private equity firms, missing the illiquidity premium and active management returns typical of direct private equity deals.  
  - Broad alternative ETFs provide diversified exposure but generally underperform specialized, actively managed hedge funds or alternative strategies.

- **Lack of Illiquidity Premium and Manager Skill**  
  Direct investments in private equity, real estate, or hedge funds often require capital lock-up and rely on skilled active management, which can add significant value.  
  ETFs trade daily and maintain liquidity, which inherently limits their ability to capture illiquidity premiums and manager alpha.

- **Higher Fees on Some Alternative ETFs**  
  Some alternative ETFs and listed private equity ETFs have relatively high expense ratios (often >1%), which can erode returns over time compared to low-cost index funds or direct investments.

- **Tax Efficiency and Structural Limitations**  
  Direct alternatives can offer tax advantages, including:  
  - Carried interest treatment in private equity  
  - Depreciation and cost recovery benefits in real estate  
  - Capital gains deferral via fund structures  
  ETFs usually lack these tax benefits due to their transparent and liquid structure.

- **Reduced Customization and Control**  
  ETFs limit investor control over specific holdings, timing, and strategy implementation, unlike direct investments or private funds where investors can negotiate terms and select deals.

- **Potential Overlap and Correlation Risks**  
  Some ETFs may have overlapping holdings, such as private equity firms included in both equity and private equity ETFs, potentially reducing diversification effectiveness.

### Summary

ETFs and mutual funds offer an **accessible, liquid, and cost-effective** way to gain broad exposure to many asset classes. For investors with smaller portfolios or limited access, they are often the best choice to start building diversification.

However, for those seeking to maximize returns and optimize tax efficiencyâ€”particularly at higher wealth levelsâ€”direct investments or specialized alternative funds may provide additional benefits through illiquidity premiums, active management, and tax advantages.

As wealth and experience grow, gradually integrating these more complex investments alongside ETFs may help build a more resilient and higher-performing portfolio over time.

- **Disclaimer**    I have not vetted all of the funds and assets here and don't necessarily recommend buying all of these different options.  My preliminary assessment is that the ETFs for private equity and alternatives may not be the best choices due to the low returns I'm seeing, though they do have the benefit of very high dividends (~8%).  I'm not against investing in gold and crypto for diversification, but please be aware of the risks.
