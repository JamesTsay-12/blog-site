A couple works (red signature) were created by my Uncle's teacher. The rest were from my Uncle (Buo Buo) who recently passed away.
I wanted to pay tribute to him by displaying his art. I was lucky to have taken pictures in my trip to Taiwan this year.
I hope you enjoy the various watercolor still life and landscape paintings.  I will write more in the future about the significance of his art in my life.
