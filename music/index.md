Welcome to my music blog! ðŸŽµ

In addition to all of my more conventional tastes in rock, blues, jazz, and classical music, I'm interested in film and video game soundtrack music and aspire to create different works in this area.  For now I've only posted things made in the distant past, but I'll add more new things as I progress.

Here I'll share:

- Songs I'm working on
- Favorite tracks
- Music production notes
- Instruments and gear I use
